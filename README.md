# Frost
### A 75% bluetooth hotswappable mechanical keyboard with over 3 months of battery.
### About:
Frost uses a nice!nano v2, and a 110mah battery that will last up to 5 months. The nice!nano gives it bluetooth, and my configuration gets all the parts for under $150(other than the case). Also uses Cherry clip-in stabilizers and kailh hotswap sockets and M2(4mm) heatset inserts and screws to fasten the pcb to the case.

### Case:

Made with Fusion 360. Available at /case.

### Firmware:

The firmware was made with ZMK, since the MCU for the keyboard(a nice!nano v2) was built specifically for use with ZMK. ZMK has inbuilt bluetooth support as well as support for displaying the batery capacity on the paired device. Firmware is at /firmware.
