# Frost
### A 75% bluetooth hotswappable mechanical keyboard with over 3 months of battery.
### About:
Frost uses a nice!nano v2, and a 110mah battery that will last up to 5 months. The nice!nano gives it bluetooth, and my configuration gets all the parts for under $150(other than the case). Also uses Cherry clip-in stabilizers and kailh hotswap sockets and M2(4mm) heatset inserts and screws to fasten the pcb to the case.
